-- ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ†âœ¨**Who I am**âœ¨ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‡
	I am @TheLudicrousVillian, but my close associates refer to me as Marcrow online on various platforms, and in general, most know me as Marley Skye Farinas; I am a sophmore at SWCTA: Southwest Career Technical Academy, who's part of the Digital Game Development program.

-- ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ†âœ¨**My Interests**âœ¨ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‡
   My interests include but are not limited to **art** of all mediums and genres, strongly excluding AI generation; **music**, my favourite genres are: vapourwave, rock, indie, pop, symphonic, and more, to summarise my music taste is incredibly diverse; however, my most listened to artists are Jack Stauber, Lemon Demon, Naked Eyes, The Romantics, The Living Tombstone, MacDemarco, The Garden, Whitewoods, ABBA, and more; in addition, I love **video games**, and on occasion, if I have the time, I most enjoy playing Ark Survival Evolved and Terraria, but I have played other games in the past, most notably the Plants Vs Zombies shooter series, Minecraft, Birthday is The Beginning, Outerworlds, Star Wars Battlefied, Subnautica, Roblox, FNAF, Star Wars Fallen Order, and Hogwarts Legacy; furthermore, my favourite **movies** growing up have been the Happy Feet, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Rio franchise, FNAF, Maze Runner, Klaus, and The Shining; moreover, I love **storywriting**, I've been inspired by countless of artists and directors of numerous mediums and media; for instance, The Shining,   Fahrenheit 451, FNAF, and Roblox: and I have made at least 2 main stories which evolved from culminated works of mine, and numerous drafts for conceptual ideas, which I therefore use for ideas regarding game development; additionally, I love **nature**, this even includes insects: for I enjoy observing and **collecting** not just crystals, rocks, and figurines of my favourite aforementioned things, but insects.
	
-- ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ†âœ¨**Why I Joined Game Development**âœ¨ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‡
	As mentioned, I love storywriting and art, and I've been inspired by my favourite video games, for I wish to share and express not just myself but my art and stories through video games, which I believe is one of the best ways to tell a story, it's immersive and a creative project you could develop with your peers; adding on, I am also interested in learning how to program, and although it's challenging like an intricate puzzle, I believe that if I dedicated the time and effort in learning, I can achieve a level of skill enough to start independantly developing my own games: and my greatest inspiration is Scott Cawthon, the indie creator of FNAF, I seek to one day make my own game that will one day provide entertainment and more to a generation similar as to how various indie games have made up my childhood.

-- ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ†âœ¨**What I've Learnt Thus Far**âœ¨ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‡
	1-17-24 -- In school, I've been taking classes to help me learn more about coding, after being obligated to take AP computer science in Freshman year, I've gained an interest in learning how to program; and so far, I've learnt most of the basics, including variable types like integars, doubles, strings, booleans, floats, and more, and am still learning more about computer science in my sophomore year in my new Computer Science advanced elective; in the aforementioned class, we learn how to code in BlueJ with the coding Language, Java, it has been challenging, especially after getting accustomed to Code.org, but sometimes fun, and I've been decently improving over the course of the last semester. Not to mention, in my game development program, we've been learning a bit of C# in Unity, and although I used Godot in Freshman year, I find Unity far more convienent than Godot. In the future, I wish to enhance my skills in both Java and C#, so that I may be able to effectively code my own projects at home, once I obtain a computer or laptop that is.
